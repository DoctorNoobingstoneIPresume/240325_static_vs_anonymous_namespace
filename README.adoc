== README

In C++, is there a difference between `static` and anonymous namespace ?

We can run `./Go` in order to build the project
and in order to also obtain the analysis of object files and linked module (via `readelf ... --symbols`).

We can then see, in `g.cpp.readelf`, that all of `f1`, `f2`, `f3` have internal linkage (`"LOCAL"`).
